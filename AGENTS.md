* Use `yarn` for package management.
* Write everything in TypeScript, including one-time throwaway scripts.
* Avoid defensive programming. To the extent possible, rely on the type system for guarantees instead.
* Ask questions if your instructions are unclear.
* After making edits, run `yarn check:fix && yarn typecheck`.
